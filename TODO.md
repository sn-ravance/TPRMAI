# TODO - AI TPRM Machine

## High Priority

- [x] ~~**Environment: Configure AI credentials** - Azure AI Foundry endpoint + API key configured, all 3 model tiers verified~~

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Testing: Add test suite** - No tests currently exist. Add Jest/Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E
- [x] ~~**UI: Review component completeness** - Check if all pages listed in features are implemented~~
- [x] ~~**AI Agents: Document agent workflows** - Create documentation for each agent's capabilities and triggers~~
- [x] ~~**API: Document endpoints** - Create API documentation for all routes~~
- [ ] **Tooling UX: Smoother /resume-it after /retrofit-it** - When a vibe coder exits Claude after using /retrofit-it and comes back via /resume-it, the experience feels disconnected. /resume-it should detect retrofit state, present clear context on what phase they're in, and make it obvious the user doesn't need to do anything technical -- just say what to work on next
- [ ] **Onboarding: Add business criticality selection** - The onboarding wizard defaults to STANDARD business criticality; add a selector step for data types accessed, system integrations, PII/PHI/PCI flags, and criticality level

## Low Priority

- [ ] **CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions** - Configure automated testing and deployment pipeline

## Completed

- [x] Import codebase to GitHub-managed local repository
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Install npm dependencies
- [x] Create make-it framework files (app-context.json, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md)
- [x] Initialize SQLite database (`npx prisma db push`)
- [x] Configure DATABASE_URL for SQLite
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors (JSON string fields, generic types)
- [x] Make LLM initialization lazy (build succeeds without AI credentials)
- [x] Consolidate dual app structure (merged /app and /src/app)
- [x] Verify build passes (`npm run build`)
- [x] **Security: Upgrade Next.js** - Upgraded from 14.2.0 to 16.1.6
- [x] **Security: Fix npm vulnerabilities** - All 22 vulnerabilities resolved (0 remaining)
- [x] **Docs: Update CLAUDE.MD** - Added Claude via Azure AI Foundry as primary AI provider
- [x] **Clarify AI provider** - Claude via Azure AI Foundry is PRIMARY, OpenAI is optional alternative only
- [x] **Replace xlsx with exceljs** - Fixed vulnerable xlsx dependency
- [x] **Retrofit Phase A** - Docker, PostgreSQL, mock-oidc
- [x] **Retrofit Phase B** - OIDC auth, database-driven RBAC, JWT sessions, admin UI, permission middleware
- [x] **Retrofit Phase C** - Multi-provider AI abstraction, model tiering, LangChain removal
- [x] **Retrofit Phase D** - UI pages (Assessments, Documents, Reports, Settings), DataTable component, admin table upgrade
- [x] **Retrofit Phase E** - Rich seed data, security headers, Terraform templates, deployment config
- [x] **Cleanup: Remove legacy files** - Removed skills/ (8.6MB generic Claude skills), diagrams/, DATABASE_SETUP.md, TPRM-Process-Requirements.md
- [x] **Cleanup: Update CLAUDE.MD** - Updated project structure and tech stack to reflect current state

  - All 6 agents updated to use tier-based model selection
  - Document analysis route rewritten to use new provider
- Removed LangChain, @langchain/openai, @langchain/core, @langchain/anthropic dependencies

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Replaced NextAuth with OIDC + stateless JWT authentication**
  - Login via SSO (mock-oidc in dev, any OIDC provider in production)
  - Stateless JWT cookie-based sessions (no server-side session store)
  - Removed NextAuth, @auth/prisma-adapter, bcryptjs dependencies
  - Removed "Continue to Demo" bypass on login page
- Consolidated 4 duplicate layouts into one shared authenticated layout using route group

### Added
- Database-driven RBAC: Role, Permission, RolePermission models in Prisma
- 4 system roles: ADMIN, ANALYST, VIEWER, VENDOR with auto-generated permissions
- Per-resource CRUD permissions for all app pages (40+ permissions)
- `requirePermission(resource, action)` middleware on all API routes
- OIDC auth flow: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/callback, /api/auth/me, /api/auth/logout
- Auth context provider (useAuth hook) for frontend permission checking
- Route-protecting middleware (redirects unauthenticated users to /login)
- Admin UI: User Management page (/admin/users)
- Admin UI: Role Management page with permission matrix (/admin/roles)

### Security
